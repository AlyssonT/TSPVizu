# TSP Solver with Golang & React

This project solves the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm in a Go API.  
Solutions are continuously improved and streamed in real time via **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.  
A **React** frontend with **Konva** dynamically visualizes the evolving routes in real time.

---

## Features

- TSP solved with metaheuristics (ILS)  
- Real-time result streaming via SSE  
- Interactive visualization with **React + Konva**  
- Fast backend in **Go**  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Golang), Event-Stream (SSE)  
- **Frontend**: React, Konva  

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go `1.20+`  
- Node.js `18+`  
- npm or yarn  

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
go run main.go
```
The backend runs on: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### Frontend Setup

You'll need a .env file to setup your API url, like this:

VITE_APT_URL=http://localhost:8080

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The frontend runs on: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Usage

1. Click on the plane to add cities (points). These will serve as the input for the ILS.
2. When youâ€™re finished, press Solve.
3. The application will stream and visualize the TSP solution as it improves in real time.

## Roadmap

- Add more metaheuristic algorithms  
- Improve visualization options
